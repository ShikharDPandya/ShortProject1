1. Sorting:
 Run MergeSort.java for sorting the numbers using MergeSort with Generics. The parameter n denotes the number of input values which we range from 1M to 16M for testing the time complexity.
 Run MergeInt.java for sorting the numbers using regular MergeSort. The parameter n denotes the number of input values which we range from 1M to 16M for testing the time complexity.
 Run InsertionSort.java for sorting the numbers using MergeSort with Generics. The parameter n denotes the number of input values which we range from 1M to 16M for testing the time complexity.

2. Diameter of Tree
 Run DC.java which takes graph as input from a file(if present) or from the console and performs diameter calculation and returns the path as a linked list.
